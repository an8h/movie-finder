# Movie Finder web app created by Anthoula Alipasali

This is a web application for showing the most popular movies, tv shows, family genre, and documentary genre.
The data are retrieved from the Movie Database API.
I used React-Router for the navigation of the app, and Redux-Thunk for manupulating the store.
The Home component renders the Logo, Sliders, and a Footer.
The Detail page shows the information about a selected movie/serie.
The Watch Video page plays in fullscreen a fallback video.

To get started you need to go to your terminal, find your project and inside the project's folder run `npm install`, and then `npm run start`.
Then go to your browser to `http://localhost:8080/`

To run the tests enter `npm test` into your terminal.
